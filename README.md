# Installation
* Download the actions folder from above.
* Rename actions folder to actions_old if you have discord.js v11 with original dbm mod.
* Copy and paste all the files and foldesr to your bot's folder (Make sure to backup previous actions and events folder).
* Copy the bot_v12.js file to your bot's folder

# Running the bot
Since dbm doesn't support Discord.js V12 you'll have to run the bot through Command prompt.

# Running the bot in the Command Prompt
This process requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v12.16.1/node-v12.16.1-x64.msi) to be installed on your computer.

To run the bot in the Command Prompt, follow these steps:
1 - Inside DBM: Press Project -> Open Project Directory
2 - Inside the Project Directory: Click the address bar at the top and delete everything in it
3 - Type cmd and press enter
4 - Inside the Command Prompt: Type: `node bot_v12.js`

### Note
Since DBM overwrites bot.js file  we'll be using bot_v12.js... so instead of typing `node bot.js` in command prompt you'll have to type `node bot_v12.js`.
